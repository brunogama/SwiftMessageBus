# Swift Message Bus MVP - Epics Summary

## Implementation Roadmap

This document provides an overview of all epics for the Swift Message Bus MVP implementation, including prioritization, dependencies, and timeline.

## Epic Overview

| Epic | Title | Priority | Duration | Dependencies | Stories |
|------|-------|----------|----------|--------------|---------|
| 1 | Core Foundation and Package Setup | P0 | Week 1 | None | 5 |
| 2 | Message Bus Actor Implementation | P0 | Week 2 | Epic 1 | 6 |
| 3 | Plugin System Architecture | P1 | Week 3 | Epic 2 | 7 |
| 4 | Performance Validation | P0 | Week 4 | Epic 2 | 6 |
| 5 | Examples and Documentation | P1 | Week 5 | Epics 1-3 | 7 |

**Total Stories**: 31
**Total Duration**: 5 weeks
**MVP Target**: End of Week 4 (with documentation following)

## Priority Definitions

- **P0 (Critical)**: Must have for MVP - framework doesn't work without it
- **P1 (High)**: Important for adoption and usability
- **P2 (Medium)**: Nice to have, can be added post-MVP

## Implementation Sequence

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
**Epic 1: Core Foundation**
- Set up Swift package structure
- Define all core protocols
- Implement message types
- Establish CI/CD pipeline
- Create initial documentation

**Key Deliverable**: Compilable Swift package with core types

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (Week 2)
**Epic 2: Message Bus Actor**
- Implement actor-based message bus
- Add event publishing
- Add command handling
- Add query processing
- Implement layer-based routing

**Key Deliverable**: Working message bus with basic functionality

### Phase 3: Extensibility & Validation (Weeks 3-4)
**Epic 3: Plugin System** (Parallel with Epic 4)
- Build plugin framework
- Implement core plugins (Logging, Retry, Metrics)
- Add middleware chain
- Create load balancer plugin

**Epic 4: Performance Validation** (Parallel with Epic 3)
- Create benchmark suite
- Validate performance targets
- Implement CI performance gates
- Compare with alternatives

**Key Deliverables**: 
- Extensible plugin system
- Performance validation confirming 100K+ msgs/sec, <1ms P99

### Phase 4: Polish & Documentation (Week 5)
**Epic 5: Examples and Documentation**
- Create Hello World example
- Build comprehensive examples
- Generate API documentation
- Write migration guides
- Create performance tuning guide

**Key Deliverable**: Production-ready framework with excellent documentation

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- ✅ 100K+ messages/second throughput
- ✅ <1ms P99 latency
- ✅ <5MB memory for 1000 subscribers
- ✅ Zero race conditions
- ✅ 95%+ test coverage

### Developer Experience Metrics
- ✅ <3 minutes to Hello World
- ✅ Type-safe API with no runtime casting
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Migration guides from major frameworks
- ✅ Rich example applications

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **Performance targets not met**
   - Mitigation: Early benchmarking in Week 2
   - Fallback: Document realistic performance

2. **Plugin system complexity**
   - Mitigation: Start with simple middleware pattern
   - Fallback: Reduce plugin types for MVP

3. **Swift macro complexity**
   - Mitigation: Defer to post-MVP if needed
   - Fallback: Manual registration APIs

## Post-MVP Roadmap

### Version 1.1 (Weeks 6-8)
- Swift macro implementation (@Subscribe, @MessageBusActor)
- Additional plugins (Circuit Breaker, Tracing, Validation)
- Server-side Swift integration examples

### Version 1.2 (Weeks 9-12)
- Distributed messaging support
- Persistence plugins
- Security plugins
- Advanced macro patterns

### Version 2.0 (Future)
- Full 40+ macro ecosystem
- Visual debugging tools
- Cross-platform support (Kotlin, TypeScript bindings)
- Enterprise features

## Development Guidelines

### Story Implementation
1. Stories should be completed sequentially within each epic
2. Each story should have tests before marking complete
3. Performance impact should be measured for each story
4. Documentation should be updated with each story

### Quality Gates
- All tests must pass
- Performance benchmarks must not regress
- Code coverage must remain above 80%
- API documentation must be complete

## Getting Started

To begin implementation:
1. Start with Epic 1, Story 1.1 (Package initialization)
2. Complete stories sequentially
3. Run benchmarks after Epic 2 completion
4. Validate performance targets before proceeding
5. Document as you build

## Notes for Development Team

- **Focus on MVP scope**: Resist feature creep beyond defined stories
- **Performance first**: Validate performance early and often
- **Type safety**: Never compromise on compile-time safety
- **Documentation**: Treat documentation as first-class deliverable
- **Test coverage**: Maintain high test coverage from the start

This roadmap provides a clear path from zero to a production-ready Swift Message Bus framework in 5 weeks.
