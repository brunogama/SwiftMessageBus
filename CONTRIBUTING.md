## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check existing issues. When creating a bug report, include:

- A clear and descriptive title
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Code samples (if applicable)
- Environment details (OS, Swift version, etc.)

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are welcome! Please provide:

- A clear and descriptive title
- A detailed description of the proposed enhancement
- Use cases for the enhancement
- Examples of how it would be used

### Your First Code Contribution

Look for these tags in our issues:

- `good first issue` - Good for newcomers
- `help wanted` - We need help with these
- `documentation` - Help improve our docs

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Swift 5.9 or later
- Xcode 15.0 or later (for macOS development)
- SwiftLint: `brew install swiftlint`
- swift-format: `brew install swift-format`

### Building the Project

```bash
# Build the project
swift build

# Run tests
swift test

# Run benchmarks
swift run -c release MessageBusBenchmarks

# Format code
make format

# Run linting
make lint
```

## Coding Standards

We use SwiftLint and swift-format with Google Swift Style Guide. Key guidelines:

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Document public APIs with DocC comments
- Prefer `let` over `var` when possible
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Code Organization

```swift
// MARK: - Properties
private let messageQueue: MessageQueue

// MARK: - Public Methods
public func start() {
    // ...
}

// MARK: - Private Methods
private func processMessage() {
    // ...
}
```

## Testing Guidelines

- Maintain minimum 80% code coverage
- Write unit tests for all public APIs
- Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Keep tests fast and isolated

```swift
func testSendMessage() async throws {
    // Given
    let message = TestMessage()
    
    // When
    let result = try await sut.send(message)
    
    // Then
    XCTAssertNotNil(result)
}
```

## Commit Message Guidelines

This project follows [Conventional Commits 1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.

### Types

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix  
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that don't affect code meaning
- **refactor**: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: Code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **build**: Changes that affect the build system
- **ci**: Changes to CI configuration
- **chore**: Other changes that don't modify src or test

### Scope

The scope should be the name of the package/module affected:

- **core**: Core message bus functionality
- **macros**: Swift macro implementations
- **plugins**: Plugin system
- **routing**: Layer-based routing
- **tests**: Test infrastructure
- **bench**: Benchmarks
- **docs**: Documentation

### Examples

```bash
# Feature

```

### Breaking Changes

Breaking changes must be indicated:

1. By appending `!` after type/scope: `feat(api)!: change handler signature`
2. By adding `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer
